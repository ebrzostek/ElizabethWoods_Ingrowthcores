Excel file contains three tabs: 
1) Litter C and N Recovery, with measurements of recovered corn root litter in each SOM pool (light POM, heavy POM, MAOM);
2) No Litter C and N Data, cores that did not recieve litter additions- with measurements of a) total soil C, N, and C:N, b) contribution of root-derived C, c) and pre-exisiting SOM across each SOM pool following incubation
3) Inorganic N Mineralization, cores that did not recieve litter additions, initial and final inorganic N concentrations, and the net rate of N mineralization over 14 days

Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVAs
